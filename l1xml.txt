=>XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

eXtensible = Extend our notation
Markup = Write using Markup
Language = Create your own document

XML is not all the same as HTML. But both are Markup Language
XML is used to describe the data.
XML must define custom rules(tags).
Need to enclose name of key within double quotes(should not use single route)

HTML is used to display the data
HTML has pre-defined rules(tags).

eg.element
<markup>Something Here</markup>

eg.attribute
<markup title="info">Something Here</markup>
